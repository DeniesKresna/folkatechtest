You can open the comment in main.go, change the variable on any question, uncomment the question will be tested and run go run main.go.
Or even you can modify the test case to debug it

For question number 2, its okay to work with any data that can be SQRT. like 9,16,25 etc.

Question number 3 shown in the image "3rdQuestionDBSchema.png". can be done with PostgreSql, even though can be done with mongo, i prefer to use relational DB schema for now.
Then for imprevement can be enhanced to noSql on some part.
